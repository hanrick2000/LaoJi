# Dynamic Programming

Feelings: \
So easy to make mistake even using recursive way ... \
Have to be extremely careful

Step 1. Define entries in the table T(i) or T(i,j) \
Step 2. Recurrence for entries interms of smaller subproblem\
(thinking about the last step)
&emsp;  T(i, j) =  T(i-1,j) if ... \
&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   T(i, j-1) if ...
Step 3. Base cases
